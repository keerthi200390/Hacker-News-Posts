    "#  Researching Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a popular website focuses on Computer science and Entrepreneurship, where technology related posts are commented and voted upon. There are two major types of posts. Ask HN and Show HN. Ask HN is where user posts specific question and Show HN is where user posts a project, product or something interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will try to find:\n",
    "\n",
    "Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Results\n",
    "After analyzing the data, we found that *Ask HN* posts receive more comments on average than *Show HN* posts. We also determined if the *Ask HN* post were create between 3.00 - 4.00 PM EST the average number of comments increases over 60%.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, please refer to our analysis below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Set\n",
    "The link to the data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). It has been downloaded to the PC and named as \"*hacker_news.csv*\"\n",
